    "So far, we learned about lists and tuples and how useful they are for working with multiple numeric and non-numeric observations in Python. However, what happens when you want to work large objects or even with two-dimensional objects (i.e., objects that contain rows and columns)? Native Pyton lists and tuples, while good, are not as efficient when you begin working with large amounts of data that might be stacked on top of eachother. That is where NumPy comes in. The NumPy library offers an object called an 'array' that can be stacked and can be used to compute several types of processes in a much faster and efficient manner. The main reason why this is possible is due to the arrays being written in C language, which allows them to be stored in contiguous memory locations within your machine, making them more accessible and easier to manipulate. NumPy also offers several statistical functions that allow us the ability to compute several analyses without having to use additional packages. Learning how NumPy operates is fundamental to being able to work with dataframes (will be discussed in the next section). <br>\n",

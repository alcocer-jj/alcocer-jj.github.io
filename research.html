                            Exploring the Effect of Colorado's Recreational
                              Marijuana Policy on Opioid Overdose Rates</a><br>
                              <i>Royal Society of Public Health, 2020, Volume 185,

      <div class="content">
      <p>Opioid overdose death rates have continued to spike exponentially
        from the start of the 21st century, creating what is known to be one
        of the worst public health crises in the United States. Simultaneously,
        as more states began passing medical cannabis laws (MCLs), the idea
        that marijuana was the solution to the opioid crisis began to spread
        nationwide. As some states have maintained strict medical marijuana
        policies, others—such as Colorado—have expanded their statutes to
        allow recreational marijuana sales within their state. Researchers
        have been able to provide sense of the public health implications
        resulting from MCLs, but little is known about the effects of this
        marijuana policy expansion. This preliminary study will focus on
        exploring the statewide effects of Colorado's recreational marijuana
        policy on the state's opioid overdose death rates.</p>
      <p>Because Colorado has existing panel data for opioid overdose death rates,
        we can use statistical software to define and create an optimal control
        group to adequately resemble Colorado's outcome variable of interest.
        This process known as the synthetic control method can provide a valid
        counterfactual for Colorado's opioid overdose outcomes in the absence
        of this policy—a Colorado that did not expand marijuana policy to the
        point recreational dispensaries were established.</p>
      <p>Opioid overdose death rate data from the Centers for Disease Control
        and Prevention's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research
        (WONDER) will be used to construct a synthetic control unit composed
        of a donor pool of states resembling Colorado's regulatory environment
        pertaining to marijuana before legalization. The synthetic control unit
        allows for a comparative observation of overdose rate trends in Colorado
        and its synthetic counterpart for the years 1999–2017, all while
        including a set of predictor variables for robustness checks. A
        difference-in-difference estimate will then help us observe the effects
        of the treatment given to Colorado. Inference tests will be conducted
        to evaluate the method's predictive power and significance of the results.</p>
      <p>The results of the synthetic control model and its outcomes showed
        that the estimated negative 5% drop in overdose death rates was deemed
        insignificant on conducting a placebo in-space analysis, meaning there
        is not enough evidence to prove that opening recreational dispensaries
        as a result of recreational marijuana legislation was instrumental in
        reducing Colorado's ongoing opioid crisis depicted through opioid
        overdose deaths.</p>

  <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>

  <div class="content">
  <p>Currently, Congress is at its highest peak of racial diversity—with 144 of 535 (27%) legislators
    identifying as non-white. While there is plenty written about how institutional factors influence
    sponsorship and cosponsorship activity, scholarship continues to tell us little about how personal
    characteristics–specifically, race and ethnicity, do so. How does the race and ethnicity of
    a legislator impact the way they sponsor and cosponsor bills? To answer this question, I leverage
    the quasi-experimental nature of the 2016 and 2018 congressional elections to employ
    a synthetic difference-in-difference (SDID) estimator that causally estimates the impact of minority
    legislators. I find that, on average, minority legislators sponsor fewer bills than non-minority
    legislators and greatly cosponsor more legislation than non-minorities do. I test the robustness of 
    these findings by applying the SDID estimator on congressional districts where legislators of the same
    group (i.e., non-minorities replacing non-minorities and minorities replacing minorities) were elected
    to office and found no significant differences in sponsorship and cosponsorship activity for either.
    The implications of these findings highlight the constraints that minority legislators have to 
    influence policy at the legislative level.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 18px" class="courses">Top-two open primary systems increase 
    ideological diversity in state legislative parties. Co-authored with <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/profile/christian-grose/">
    Christian Grose</a>. October 2023.</p>
  <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>

  <div class="content">
  <p>Does the top-two primary increase ideological heterogeneity in parties in state legislatures? 
    We argue and find that the possibility of same-party elections in the top-2 leads to greater 
    diversity within party caucuses in state legislatures; in contrast to closed primary systems. 
    In closed primaries, party caucuses are less ideologically diverse as reelection incentives 
    for all members within the caucus are similar. In top-two states, party caucuses will have 
    greater ideological diversity as some candidates will face primary reelection incentives to 
    move to the extreme; while other candidates will face general election reelection incentives. 
    We test this using a synthetic control model. We find causal evidence that the top-two primary 
    has increased ideological diversity in both the majority and minority party caucuses in some 
    legislative chambers. This effect persists for Democratic party caucuses after adoption of 
    top-two, but this effect for Republican party caucuses is only for a few time periods before 
    it reverts back to pre-treatment lower ideological heterogeneity. Implications for the top-2 
    and top-4 systems are discussed..</p>

      Female Legislators Better Communicators? March 2022.</p>
    <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>

    <div class="content">
    <p>This paper explores the concept of 'gendered vulnerability' posited by
      Steigerwalt and Lazarus (2018) and extends it beyond legislative activity.
      I argue that congresswomen are more driven to establish legitimation
      through speech in order to secure reelection stability. In turn, I expect
      congresswomen's messages to be more polished than congressmen's messages.
      I collect congressional Twitter data across 5 years and calculate both
      readability and lexical diversity scores to convert them into dependent
      variables. I then run multivariate regression models to observe the
      effects of gender on these measures of communication. As a robustness
      check, I use an unsupervised machine learning topic model (LDA) to
      separate political speech over nonpolitical speech and compare how both
      types of tweets fare in these variables across female and male legislators.</p>

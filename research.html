  Overview
</h2>
  <section class="intro-section">
      <div>
          <div class="intro-paragraph">
              <p>
                My research asks how race, identity, and institutional design shape political
                representation in the American context. I study how legislators from marginalized
                communities—especially racial and gender minorities—navigate institutional 
                constraints and adopt responsive behaviors to influence policy. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Much of my work focuses on bill sponsorship and cosponsorship as agenda setting and 
                coalition-building tools for shaping policy under conditions of exclusion. 
                I’m especially interested in how formal rules (e.g., seniority) and institutional 
                pressures (e.g., partisan caucuses) interact with identity to structure political agency. 
              </p>
              <p>
                At its core, my research investigates how American democratic institutions 
                distribute voice, and how that distribution reflects deeper structures of power 
                and inequality. As my work expands, I aim to explore how these dynamics play out 
                in the judicial realm, specifically how identity and institutional context can 
                shape judicial behavior and policy interpretation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alongside this work, I’m developing methods that bring together causal 
                inference, machine learning, and computational social science to better 
                study political behavior in high-dimensional, institutionally complex 
                settings. I’m especially interested in how to improve inference in 
                overdispersed count data, staggered treatment adoptions, and online 
                survey experiments affected by synthetic or biased data. 
              </p>
              <p>
                These methodological interests are not detached from my substantive work. 
                They grow out of a need to model strategic behavior under constraint, to 
                uncover patterns that conventional approaches often miss, and to do justice 
                to the messiness of real political data. These interests are driven by a 
                core belief that better tools help us ask better questions, and that rigorous 
                methods, when paired with critical theory, can help illuminate the deeper 
                structures of exclusion and power that shape democratic life.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also serve as a key researcher for the <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/everydayrespect/">
                Everday Respect Project</a>, which brings together researchers, community members, 
                and city officials to study officer-driver communication during police 
                traffic stops. In this work, I help design and lead analyses that combine 
                large-scale natural language processing, causal inference, and community-validated 
                survey data to assess how everyday state-citizen interactions reproduce
                or repair racial inequality. 
              </p> 
              <p>
                As part of this project, I work closely with computer scientists and 
                data engineers to build scalable annotation pipelines for body-worn camera 
                footage, acting as a bridge between social theory and data architecture. 
                This project reflects a broader commitment in my research. To use data 
                science not just for prediction or efficiency, but for accountability, 
                equity, and democratic renewal. The list below includes all of my published 
                research. You can find information about working papers and articles under

            This study examines how racial identity affects legislative responsiveness in Mexico using an 
            email-based audit experiment. Emails from simulated Indigenous, Mestiza, and European-White 
            constituents were sent to all 626 federal legislators to test whether perceived identity shapes 
            replies and their quality. Contrary to expectations, Indigenous-named constituents received 
            significantly higher response rates that were more personalized and helpful than their 
            European-White counterparts, while Mestiza-named constituents showed no significant differences 
            in response rates. We found no coalition-based differences, though power was limited, and 
            responsiveness declined in districts with larger Indigenous populations, revealing how national 
            inclusion norms may be moderated by local demographic and political dynamics.

            In the US Congress, a key signal of a legislator’s effectiveness is their sponsorship
            of bills, but minority representatives, particularly women of color, often face
            institutional and informal barriers to sponsoring legislation. In new research, I
            explore how minority representatives work around these constraints by
            cosponsoring bills. I find that newly elected minority members are likely to have a
            20 percent higher cosponsorship rate compared to their white predecessors, and
            that this rate is even greater for legislators who are women of color.

            How do race, ethnicity, and gender shape a legislator’s approach to 
            bill sponsorship and cosponsorship? This paper examines how institutional
            marginalization influences the legislative strategies of racial and 
            gender minority representatives. Constrained by systemic barriers that 
            limit their ability to sponsor legislation, minority legislators prioritize 
            cosponsorship to achieve policy goals, build coalitions, and demonstrate 
            responsiveness to their constituencies. Using the quasi-experimental 
            context of the 2016 and 2018 U.S. congressional elections, I apply the 
            synthetic difference-in-differences estimator and find that minority 
            legislators sponsor fewer bills but cosponsor significantly more than their 
            non-Hispanic White counterparts. Additionally, race-gendered effects reveal 
            that women of color sponsor significantly less legislation than non-minority 
            legislators and men of color. These patterns cannot be explained by factors 
            like freshman status or primary election competitiveness. The findings 
            highlight the strategic adaptations of minority legislators to navigate 
            structural inequities and amplify their legislative influence. 
            This study is the first to use a causal inference approach to explore 
            the intersection of race, gender, and sponsorship and cosponsorship of 
            congressional bills, contributing to a deeper understanding of legislative 
            behavior among marginalized groups.

            Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) is frequently promoted as an alternative to 
            Plurality Voting, with the goal of enhancing democratic representation.
            As its gained traction across various jurisdictions—ranging from states 
            like Alaska and Maine to cities like New York and San Francisco—the 
            impact of RCV on minority communities has become a critical area of 
            research and debate. While the adoption and awareness of RCV continue to
            expand, scholars have increasingly raised concerns about its effectiveness
            in fulfilling its promises of improved representation and equity. Some 
            of the literature has shown that RCV often falls short in addressing 
            these goals, particularly for underrepresented minority groups. As such, 
            there is a growing need to critically assess RCV's limitations and explore 
            alternative voting methods that may more effectively promote fair representation.
            One such alternative is Approval Voting, which presents a promising approach
            to overcoming the shortcomings of RCV. Approval Voting could offer a more 
            equitable solution, especially in terms of its impact on minority voters.

            The America (Mis)Represented: 2022 Election Report investigates the 
            prevalence and consequences of vote splitting in the United States’ 
            2022 election cycle. Vote splitting—where multiple candidates divide 
            the vote in plurality systems—frequently results in non-majority winners, 
            undermining representative outcomes. Analyzing 5,662 national primary 
            elections, the report finds that 11.9% exhibited vote-splitting dynamics, 
            with pronounced effects in states such as New Hampshire, Arizona, and 
            California. Voter dissatisfaction has intensified, with public confidence 
            in democracy dropping from 41% in 2021 to 31% by 2024. Logistic regression
             analyses reveal that open-seat and competitive races are significantly 
             more prone to vote splitting. The report advocates for reforms such as 
             approval voting, which mitigates vote distortion and better captures 
             voter preferences. Evidence from simulations, including California’s 
             2024 Senate primary, suggests that such reforms could lead to more 
             representative electoral outcomes.

            How has the legalization of recreational marijuana shaped opioid overdose deaths in 
            Colorado? While prior research has examined the effects of medical cannabis laws, less is 
            known about the public health consequences of broader marijuana policy liberalization. In 
            this study, I use the synthetic control method to estimate the effect of Colorado’s 2014 
            policy change, comparing the state to a data-driven composite of similar states from 1999 
            to 2017. Using CDC WONDER data, I construct a counterfactual scenario in which Colorado did 
            not legalize recreational cannabis, incorporating relevant predictors of opioid mortality. 
            I supplement this approach with a difference-in-differences estimate and conduct placebo 
            inference tests to assess robustness. The results suggest a 5% decline in opioid overdose 
            deaths following legalization, but this effect is not statistically significant. These 
            findings offer limited evidence that recreational marijuana access meaningfully reduced 
            opioid-related mortality in Colorado, underscoring the need for more nuanced evaluations 
            of drug policy reform.

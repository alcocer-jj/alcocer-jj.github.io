                            Exploring the Effect of Colorado's Recreational
                              Marijuana Policy on Opioid Overdose Rates</a><br>

      <div class="content">
      <p>Opioid overdose death rates have continued to spike exponentially
        from the start of the 21st century, creating what is known to be one
        of the worst public health crises in the United States. Simultaneously,
        as more states began passing medical cannabis laws (MCLs), the idea
        that marijuana was the solution to the opioid crisis began to spread
        nationwide. As some states have maintained strict medical marijuana
        policies, others—such as Colorado—have expanded their statutes to
        allow recreational marijuana sales within their state. Researchers
        have been able to provide sense of the public health implications
        resulting from MCLs, but little is known about the effects of this
        marijuana policy expansion. This preliminary study will focus on
        exploring the statewide effects of Colorado's recreational marijuana
        policy on the state's opioid overdose death rates.</p>
      <p>Because Colorado has existing panel data for opioid overdose death rates,
        we can use statistical software to define and create an optimal control
        group to adequately resemble Colorado's outcome variable of interest.
        This process known as the synthetic control method can provide a valid
        counterfactual for Colorado's opioid overdose outcomes in the absence
        of this policy—a Colorado that did not expand marijuana policy to the
        point recreational dispensaries were established.</p>
      <p>Opioid overdose death rate data from the Centers for Disease Control
        and Prevention's Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research
        (WONDER) will be used to construct a synthetic control unit composed
        of a donor pool of states resembling Colorado's regulatory environment
        pertaining to marijuana before legalization. The synthetic control unit
        allows for a comparative observation of overdose rate trends in Colorado
        and its synthetic counterpart for the years 1999–2017, all while
        including a set of predictor variables for robustness checks. A
        difference-in-difference estimate will then help us observe the effects
        of the treatment given to Colorado. Inference tests will be conducted
        to evaluate the method's predictive power and significance of the results.</p>
      <p>The results of the synthetic control model and its outcomes showed
        that the estimated negative 5% drop in overdose death rates was deemed
        insignificant on conducting a placebo in-space analysis, meaning there
        is not enough evidence to prove that opening recreational dispensaries
        as a result of recreational marijuana legislation was instrumental in
        reducing Colorado's ongoing opioid crisis depicted through opioid
        overdose deaths.</p>

  <div class="content">
  <p>Does the top-two primary increase ideological heterogeneity in parties in state legislatures? 
    We argue and find that the possibility of same-party elections in the top-2 leads to greater 
    diversity within party caucuses in state legislatures; in contrast to closed primary systems. 
    In closed primaries, party caucuses are less ideologically diverse as reelection incentives 
    for all members within the caucus are similar. In top-two states, party caucuses will have 
    greater ideological diversity as some candidates will face primary reelection incentives to 
    move to the extreme; while other candidates will face general election reelection incentives. 
    We test this using a synthetic control model. We find causal evidence that the top-two primary 
    has increased ideological diversity in both the majority and minority party caucuses in some 
    legislative chambers. This effect persists for Democratic party caucuses after adoption of 
    top-two, but this effect for Republican party caucuses is only for a few time periods before 
    it reverts back to pre-treatment lower ideological heterogeneity. Implications for the top-2 
    and top-4 systems are discussed..</p>

      Examining the Effects of Race on Legislative Activity Through Bill Cosponsorship. June 2022.</p>
    <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>

    <div class="content">
    <p>As congressional diversity continues to increase, it is important for the
    study of Representation to understand how racial identity can impact
    representation. This study contributes to the literature by examining the
    differences between minority representatives’ legislative activity in
    comparison to their non-minority counterparts. I apply the synthetic control
    method to 11 districts that had racial turnovers during the 2018 midterm
    elections in order to construct counterfactual districts and examine the average causal
    effects of race on bill cosponsorship. I find that legislators of color
    significantly cosponsor more bills than white legislators, contradicting
    previous studies observing this relationship. Upon conducting a difference-in-differences,
    the average effects of having a minority legislator in office led to an estimated increase of
    116 bills cosponsored. Running the method's inferential permutation tests using bootstrapped samples 
    of the control districts showed that the average effects observed were significant and extremely 
    unlikely to be due to random chance.</p>

      Female Legislators Better Communicators? March 2022.</p>
    <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>

    <div class="content">
    <p>This paper explores the concept of 'gendered vulnerability' posited by
      Steigerwalt and Lazarus (2018) and extends it beyond legislative activity.
      I argue that congresswomen are more driven to establish legitimation
      through speech in order to secure reelection stability. In turn, I expect
      congresswomen's messages to be more polished than congressmen's messages.
      I collect congressional Twitter data across 5 years and calculate both
      readability and lexical diversity scores to convert them into dependent
      variables. I then run multivariate regression models to observe the
      effects of gender on these measures of communication. As a robustness
      check, I use an unsupervised machine learning topic model (LDA) to
      separate political speech over nonpolitical speech and compare how both
      types of tweets fare in these variables across female and male legislators.</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px" class="courses">

    My research focuses on the intersection of legislative institutions, 
    race and ethnicity, political behavior, and policy-making. I examine 
    how racial minority legislators navigate institutional challenges and 
    employ strategic behaviors to represent their communities and influence 
    policy outcomes, with a particular focus on cooperation and representation
     across racial lines. Additionally, I explore how race and electoral 
     competition shape legislative behavior, including sponsorship and 
     cosponsorship dynamics, while investigating how voting systems and 
     institutional designs influence policy diversity and governance. 
     Methodologically, I incorporate advanced tools such as Artificial 
     Intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), natural language 
     processing (NLP), and statistical inference to analyze large-scale 
     political data, uncover patterns in legislative behavior, and assess 
     political discourse. This allows me to provide data-driven insights 
     into how political elites engage with marginalized communities and 
     influence perceptions of government legitimacy and fairness. My 
     research aims to shed light on the broader implications of race, 
     identity, and institutional structures in shaping political outcomes.

                              Marijuana Policy on Opioid Overdose Rates</a><br>

      <div class="content">
      <p>Opioid overdose deaths have surged dramatically in the 21st century, 
        marking one of the most severe public health crises in the United States. 
        As medical cannabis laws (MCLs) expanded across states, many began to 
        speculate whether marijuana could mitigate the opioid epidemic. While 
        existing research explores the health implications of MCLs, less is known 
        about the impact of broader marijuana policy liberalization. This preliminary 
        study examines the effect of Colorado's shift to legalized recreational 
        marijuana on opioid overdose death rates.</p>
      <p>Using panel data on opioid overdose mortality, this study employs the 
        synthetic control method to construct a counterfactual—an estimate of 
        what Colorado’s overdose trends would have looked like had recreational 
        dispensaries not been introduced. This approach enables a robust comparison 
        between Colorado and a composite of similar states from 1999 to 2017.</p>
      <p>Data from the CDC’s Wide-ranging Online Data for Epidemiologic Research
        (WONDER) are used to build the synthetic control unit, with pre-legalization 
        predictor variables and robustness checks incorporated. A difference-in-differences 
        framework complements the synthetic control to estimate the treatment effect, 
        with placebo inference testing applied to assess significance.</p>
      <p>Findings suggest a 5% decline in Colorado's opioid overdose rate post-legalization; 
        however, this effect was not statistically significant based on placebo in-space 
        analysis. These results offer limited evidence that recreational marijuana 
        legislation meaningfully curbed opioid-related deaths in Colorado.</p>

    Willingness to Cooperate Across Racial Groups in Legislative Cosponsorship.</b>
  </p>
  <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>

  <div class="content">
  <p>This study investigates whether minority (Black and Latine) Congressmembers are more 
    inclined than White legislators to engage in cooperative behaviors via bill cosponsorship, 
    both within their own racial and ethnic groups and with White legislators. Building 
    upon theories of social identity and marginalized electoral vulnerability, 
    I examine whether minority legislators strategically cosponsor bills introduced 
    by White legislators more frequently than White legislators cosponsor bills 
    introduced by minority legislators. By analyzing cosponsorship patterns from 
    multiple congressional sessions and employing fixed-effects Seemingly Unrelated 
    Negative Binomial Regression (SUNBR) models, I provide a nuanced understanding 
    of how identity influences legislative collaboration.</p>

  <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>

  <div class="content">
  <p>This study examines whether racial differences in legislative behavior, specifically bill 
    sponsorship and cosponsorship, exist between Minority (Black and Latino) and Non-minority 
    (White) legislators in the U.S. Congress, even after accounting for electoral conditions 
    such as district competitiveness and changes in House majority control. Using data from the 
    95th to the 117th Congresses, I employ Propensity Score Matching (PSM) using Gradient 
    Boosting (GB) to create comparable groups of Minority and White legislators. 
    Following matching, I implement a Multilevel Model (MLM) with fixed effects for 
    congressional sessions to analyze how individual-level factors, district characteristics, 
    and temporal political environments influence bill sponsorship and cosponsorship. 
    This study’s findings aim to provide a nuanced understanding of how race and electoral 
    conditions interact to shape legislative strategies over time, contributing to the broader 
    discourse on representation and policymaking in a diverse political landscape.</p>

  <p style="font-size: 18px" class="courses"><b>La Raza: Race and Legislator’s Responsiveness to Indigenous
    Constituents in Mexico.</b>
    Co-authored with José Muzquiz (USC).
  </p>
  <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>

  <div class="content">
  <p>This audit experiment examines the responsiveness of Mexican legislators to constituents 
    from different racial groups through an email experiment using simulated constituents with 
    racially coded names. Legislators were randomly assigned to receive the same message from 
    one of three constituent profiles: Indigenous, mestiza, or European. The findings reveal 
    that legislators responded more frequently and were more likely to engage with the 
    Indigenous profile compared to the mestiza and European profiles. This study fills a 
    notable gap in the literature by centering indigeneity in audit experiments, which has 
    been largely overlooked. Additionally, it represents the first audit study to explore 
    racial discrimination in the context of Mexican politics.</p>

    Co-authored with Esther Gonzalez (USC) and Cynthia Wilkes (US OES-GSA).
  </p>
  <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>

  <div class="content">
  <p>This study explores the relationship between perceptions of procedural and distributive 
    justice and burnout among local government employees, using data from a 2018 survey of 
    over 1,000 employees in Los Angeles County. Testing the Conservation of Resources (COR) 
    Theory and the Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) Model, we applied a series of OLS regressions 
    to examine the impact of fairness perceptions on burnout outcomes. The results show that 
    lower perceptions of procedural fairness are strongly associated with higher levels of 
    emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and inefficacy. While distributive fairness also affects 
    burnout, its influence is less pronounced. Significant variations are observed across 
    gender and racial groups, with women of color experiencing the highest levels of emotional 
    exhaustion and cynicism. These findings underscore the importance of procedural fairness 
    in reducing burnout and highlight the need for equitable processes to improve employee 
    well-being and retention in local government settings.</p>

    <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>

    <div class="content">
    <p>The extant literature on bureaucratic delegation outlines the political 
      conditions under which principals should delegate discretion to agents and 
      offers a variety of procedural and ex-post mechanisms for controlling agent 
      behavior. These studies, however, often focus on bureaucrats at the federal 
      level. This national focus obscures how theories of political control 
      translate into environments in which bureaucrats have tremendous discretion, 
      as is true for policing. To what extent are efforts to reduce the discretion 
      of street-level bureaucrats successful in affecting bureaucratic behavior? 
      We address the question by assessing the impact of a 2022 departmental change 
      in the criteria needed for LAPD officers to conduct pretextual stops, in effect 
      reducing police discretion by requiring evidence of both a traffic violation and 
      “articulable information.” Using traffic stop data from the Racial and Identity 
      Profiling Act of 2015 and employing a synthetic difference-in-difference design 
      to construct a synthetic LAPD from departments across California, we find 
      that the policy change on average reduced the proportion of pretextual 
      stops conducted by ten percentage points. Consistent with street-level 
      bureaucracy theory, however, our evidence suggests that officers exert 
      considerable influence over the implementation of policy and the threat 
      of departmental sanctions.</p>

    <p>Currently, Congress is at its highest peak of racial diversity—with 27% of legislators 
      identifying as non-white. While there is plenty written about how institutional factors influence
      sponsorship and cosponsorship activity, scholarship continues to tell us little about how race
      and ethnicity do so. How does the race and ethnicity of a legislator impact the way they sponsor
      and cosponsor bills? I leverage the quasi-experimental nature of the 2016 and 2018 
      congressional elections to employ a synthetic difference-in-difference (SDID) estimator that 
      causally estimates the impact of minority legislators. I find that, on average, minority 
      legislators sponsor fewer bills than non-minority legislators and greatly cosponsor more
       legislation. These negative effects on bill sponsorship are exacerbated when minority 
       legislators out-primary an incumbent. The implications of these findings highlight the 
       constraints that minority legislators have to influence policy at the legislative level.</p>

    <div class="content">
    <p>This study explores how police officers, as street-level bureaucrats, 
      shape public perceptions of policy representation and state legitimacy. 
      While racial disparities in policing are well-documented, less attention 
      is given to how these disparities influence public attitudes. Through 
      a mixed-methods approach, we examine survey data and interviews from Los
       Angeles residents about their experiences and expectations during 
       traffic stops. Despite sharing similar preferences for respectful 
       and fair treatment, Black and Latino residents report significantly 
       more negative experiences compared to White residents, and perceive 
       a greater gap between their expectations and actual police behavior.
       These findings highlight that while policy expectations may be 
       consistent across racial groups, the experiences of Black and 
       Latine communities with police differ significantly. This study 
       underscores the need to consider not just formal policies but also 
       the actions of street-level bureaucrats in shaping public attitudes

    <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>
  
    <div class="content">
    <p>Does the top-two primary increase ideological heterogeneity in parties in state legislatures? 
      We argue and find that the possibility of same-party elections in the top-2 leads to greater 
      diversity within party caucuses in state legislatures; in contrast to closed primary systems. 
      In closed primaries, party caucuses are less ideologically diverse as reelection incentives 
      for all members within the caucus are similar. In top-two states, party caucuses will have 
      greater ideological diversity as some candidates will face primary reelection incentives to 
      move to the extreme; while other candidates will face general election reelection incentives. 
      We test this using a synthetic control model. We find causal evidence that the top-two primary 
      has increased ideological diversity in both the majority and minority party caucuses in some 
      legislative chambers. This effect persists for Democratic party caucuses after adoption of 
      top-two, but this effect for Republican party caucuses is only for a few time periods before 
      it reverts back to pre-treatment lower ideological heterogeneity. Implications for the top-2 
      and top-4 systems are discussed..</p>

      </p>
    <button class="collapsible">Abstract</button>

    <div class="content">
    <p>This study investigates how legislators prioritize non-rollcall activities—such 
      as constituency service, district outreach, media relations, and fundraising—when 
      anticipating different levels of electoral competition. It also examines how 
      these priorities differ across racial identities, with a focus on 
      how minority legislators may face unique electoral pressures. Using a 
      randomized survey experiment, members of Congress will be primed to expect 
      either a highly competitive or very safe election and asked to rank the
      importance of various non-rollcall activities for ensuring their electoral 
      success. The findings will provide insights into the intersection of race, 
      electoral strategy, and legislative behavior, contributing to broader discussions
